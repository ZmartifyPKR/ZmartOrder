# ZmartScan by Zmartify

Order and inventory handling with barcodes.

ZmartScan is an app that can be downloaded from Apple Store or Google Play.

ZmartScan offers facilities to order and create stock transactions directly from a smartphone.

The application requires access to the internet while using it. The ZmartScan organisation does not use incoming data or aggregated data from you. The only purpose is to simplify communication between buyer and seller.
